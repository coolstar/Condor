Enhancer collects small subsets of information, so we can analyse which versions of Enhancer are being used. It is sent completely anonymously. No data sent can be used to track who you are. Due to the nature of HTTP, your IP address must be sent, because of the way web servers work. IP addresses are never used other than to send back the bytes needed. Some resources are fetched in realtime by Enhancer, to make easier, secure updates and improve user experience. Any and all requests sent to the Enhancer server is sent over HTTPS.
